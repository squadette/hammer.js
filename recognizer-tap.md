# Hammer.Tap(options)
Recognized when the pointer is doing a small tap/click. Multiple taps are recognized if they occur between the given
interval and position.  The eventData from the emitted event contains the property `tapCount`,
which contains the amount of multi-taps being recognized.

If an Tap recognizer has a failing requirement, it waits the interval time before emitting the event. This is
because if you want to only trigger a doubletap, hammer needs to see if any other taps are coming in.
